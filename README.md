## EngineWorks\Templates\Templates

This class works as a factory of `Template` objects,
it helps to locate this objects with a common `Callables` object,
in a common directory with a common file extension.

The most common used method would be `fetch`.
It simply create a `Template` using the file specified by directory + name + extension, with the default callables
Then will call fetch on that template.

## EngineWorks\Templates\Template

This is the main class of the library, it can be created stand alone
or by `Templates::create`.

A `Template` has a read-only property (accesible by `callables()` method).
No, it is not a good idea to implement the magic method `__get` for only this property.

### EngineWorks\Templates\Template::fetch
`fetch` method receives two arguments, a filename and a variables array.
 It will convert the array to variables (using `extract`) in order to make accesible this variables to the file.
 
# Inside the template

The template file is a PHP file, it will have all the variables that were set to fetch method.
Also you can use `$this`, wich is refered to the `Template` object.

The `$this` object offer some functions registered in the `Callables` object, in the example above the `$callables`
was attatched with the following functions:

- `e($string, $this->getDefaultHtmlFlags())`: escape as html
- `js($string)`: escape as javascript
- `uri($string)`: escape as uri (see `rawurlencode`)
- `url($url, $vars)`: create a url with the defined `$vars`
- `qry($vars)`: create a query string with the defined `$vars`
- `fn($number, $decimals = $this->getDefaultDecimals())`: return a formatted number
- `tr($message, $arguments, $encoder = $this->getDefaultEncoder())`: return a transliterated message, very useful for
  inline templates, like `hello {name}, i sent you an email to {email}`

So, you can use those functions using `$this` inside your template.

This is a template example `users-list.php`:

```php
<h1><?=$this->e($pagename)?></h1>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($users as $user): ?>
    <li>User: <b><?=$this->tr('{fullname} ({nickname})', $user)?></b></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

This is the templates call:

```php
$templates->fetch('users-list', [
    'pagename' => 'List of users & members',
    'users' => [
        ['fullname' => 'John Doe', 'nickname' => 'jdoe'], 
        ['fullname' => 'Carlos C Soto', 'nickname' => 'eclipxe'], 
    ],
]);
```

This would be the result:

```html
<h1>List of users &amp; members</h1>
<ul>
    <li>User: <b>John Doe (jdoe)</b></li>
    <li>User: <b>Carlos C Soto (eclipxe)</b></li>
</ul>
```
