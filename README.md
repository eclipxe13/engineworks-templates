This library is just for running PHP Templates.
Similar projects: [Slim/Php-View](https://github.com/slimphp/PHP-View)

PHP is a powerfull template engine by itself, you might not need a template library as Twig, Plates or Smarty.
It depends on the problem you are facing, maybe you are working with a legacy system, maybe you just don't want it.

# Instalation

Use composer to install this library `composer require eclipxe/engineworks-templates`

# Basic use

```php
<?php namespace EngineWorks\Templates;

// create callables
$callables = new Callables();
$callables->attachAll([
    new Plugins\HtmlEscape(),
    new Plugins\FormatNumber(),
    new Plugins\Transliterate(),
]);

// create resolver
$resolver = new Resolver(__DIR__ . '/templates');

// create templates
$templates = new Templates($callables, $resolver);

// fetch the content of a template (templates/user-details.php)
/* @var $user array */
$content = $templates->fetch('user-details', ['user' => $user]);

// do whatever with the response, I will just echo it
echo $content;
```

## EngineWorks\Templates\Templates

This class works as a factory of `Template` objects,
it helps to locate this objects with a common `Callables` object,
in a common directory with a common file extension.

The most common used method would be `fetch`.
It simply creates a `Template` using the file specified by directory + name + extension, with the default callables
Then will call `fetch` on that template.

## EngineWorks\Templates\Template

This is the main class of the library, it can be created stand alone
or by `Templates::create` (non-static call).

### EngineWorks\Templates\Template::fetch

`fetch` method receives two arguments, a template name and a variables array.
 It will resolve the file name using the Resolver object.
 It will convert the array to variables (using `extract`) in order to make accesible these variables to the file.
 
# Inside the template

The template file is a PHP file, it will have all the variables that were set to fetch method.
Also, you can use `$this`, wich is refered to the `Template` object.

The `$this` object offer some functions registered in the `Callables` object, in the example above the `$callables`
was attatched with the following functions:

- `e($string, $this->getDefaultHtmlFlags())`: escape as html
- `js($string)`: escape as javascript
- `ejs($string)`: escape as html and then as javascript
- `uri($string)`: escape as uri (see `rawurlencode`)
- `url($url, $vars)`: create an url with the defined `$vars`
- `qry($vars)`: create a query string with the defined `$vars`
- `fn($number, $decimals = $this->getDefaultDecimals())`: return a formatted number
- `tr($message, $arguments, $encoder = $this->getDefaultEncoder())`: return a transliterated message, very useful for
  inline templates, like `hello {name}, I sent you an email to {email}`

So, you can use those functions using `$this` inside your template.

Also, you can use the `fetch` method to retrieve the content of another template.

This is a template example `templates/users-list.php`:

```php
<?php
/* @var $pagename string */
/* @var $users array */
?>
<h1><?=$this->e($pagename)?></h1>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($users as $user): ?>
    <li>User: <b><?=$this->tr('{fullname} ({nickname})', $user)?></b></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

This is the templates call:

```php
<?php
/* @var $templates \EngineWorks\Templates\Templates */
$templates->fetch('users-list', [
    'pagename' => 'List of users & members',
    'users' => [
        ['fullname' => 'John Doe', 'nickname' => 'jdoe'], 
        ['fullname' => 'Carlos C Soto', 'nickname' => 'eclipxe'], 
    ],
]);
```

This would be the result:

```html
<h1>List of users &amp; members</h1>
<ul>
    <li>User: <b>John Doe (jdoe)</b></li>
    <li>User: <b>Carlos C Soto (eclipxe)</b></li>
</ul>
```
## Integrate with PSR-7

In order to integrate with a PSR-7 compatible library you can use the method `render`.
This method is act as a decorator to fetch the template and write the contents into
the `ResponseInterface` object.

You only need to use this method in case you are using a PSR-7 compatible library.
Otherwise, I recommend you to use `fetch` method. As this is optional, the psr/http-message package
is not a composer dependence but a suggestion.

## Integrate with Slim 4

To use this library in Slim 4 we provide a plugin named `Slim4Plugin` that offers two methods:
- `pathFor`: shortcut for `\Slim\Interfaces\RouteParserInterface::urlFor` method
- `baseUrl`: return `baseUrl` property (setup from `\Slim\App::getBasePath`)

This is a common code to attach the plugin into the `Callables` collection:

```php
<?php
/* @var $callables \EngineWorks\Templates\Callables */
/* @var $app Slim\App */
$callables->attach(new \EngineWorks\Templates\Slim\Slim4Plugin(
    $app->getRouteCollector()->getRouteParser(),
    $app->getBasePath()
));
```
